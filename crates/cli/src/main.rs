//! `codypendent` — CLI entry point.
//!
//! Phase 0 surface:
//!
//! ```text
//! codypendent daemon start
//! codypendent daemon status [--json]
//! codypendent daemon stop
//! ```
//!
//! STEP 1.13 adds the headless JSONL client:
//!
//! ```text
//! codypendent run --objective "..." [--mode build] [--repo PATH] --jsonl
//! codypendent attach <SESSION_ID> [--from-sequence N] --events jsonl
//! ```
//!
//! STEP 1.12 makes the bare invocation open the interactive TUI:
//!
//! ```text
//! codypendent            # opens the TUI for the current repository's session
//! ```
//!
//! Phase 5 STEP 5.1 adds workflow-manifest validation:
//!
//! ```text
//! codypendent workflow validate path/to/workflow.yaml
//! ```
//!
//! Phase 6 STEP 6.1 adds plugin inspection and permission-diffing:
//!
//! ```text
//! codypendent plugin inspect path/to/plugin.toml
//! codypendent plugin diff installed.toml update.toml
//! ```
