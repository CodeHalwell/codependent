//! The agent-context assembler (Chapter 05–07, STEP 2.3–2.5 seam).
//!
//! The individual fabric surfaces — the [`repository_map`](crate::repomap), the
//! hybrid [`retrieve`] funnel, and the scoped [`MemoryStore`] — each answer one
//! question well. This module folds all three into the single artifact a run
//! actually consumes: a [`ContextManifest`] whose [`render`](ContextManifest::render)
//! is the text block that opens a run's trace, satisfying the Phase-2 exit
//! criterion "agent context includes repository map + cited memories + retrieved
//! tool/skill cards".
//!
//! It is a pool-driven read: it never writes authority. Like the fabric's other
//! managers it is stateless — everything flows from the `pool` and the request —
//! and it projects the rich knowledge types down to the plain, serde-friendly
//! `Context*` shapes so a consumer (the daemon's run executor, a UI) never has to
//! name the retrieval/memory/graph internals to display a manifest.
