//! The syntax-layer code graph (Chapter 07, STEP 2.5).
//!
//! Tree-sitter parses a source file into the durable graph: the important
//! symbols (files, modules, types, traits, functions, methods, constants, and
//! tests — never local variables) as [`CodeNode`]s keyed by a position-stable
//! [`SymbolKey`], and the `Contains` / `Defines` / `Imports` / `Calls`-as-written
//! relations between them as evidence-backed [`CodeEdge`]s.
//!
//! Which files those are is decided in exactly one place — [`language_for`] —
//! consulted both by the parser here and by the daemon's scanner. When they were
//! two independent lists the scanner's was `*.rs` only, so every Python or
//! TypeScript repository produced an empty graph and nothing said so.
//!
//! Only the *syntax* layer lives here (semantic/LSP resolution is Phase 4), so a
//! call edge is recorded "as written" — resolved to a local definition when the
//! written name matches one in the same file, otherwise pointed at a synthesized
//! [`CodeNodeKind::ExternalDependency`] node — and carries the Chapter 07
//! confidence of [`SYNTAX_CALL_CONFIDENCE`] with [`EvidenceKind::SyntaxInferred`].
//!
//! Persistence mirrors the house conventions ([`crate::outbox`],
//! `daemon::artifacts`): a stateless free function takes `pool: &SqlitePool`,
//! (de)serializes rows by binding columns, and does every write inside a single
//! `pool.begin()` transaction that also appends the index-outbox rows so the
//! authoritative write and its `SymbolChanged` events are atomic.
