//! The per-frame and per-keystroke paths of the TUI shell.
//!
//! # Why these two, and not something else
//!
//! `render` and `reduce` are the only two functions the shell's event loop
//! calls per event (see the crate docs' loop diagram). Everything else in the
//! crate is reached THROUGH one of them, so instrumenting them covers the hot
//! surface without pinning a benchmark to a private helper that a refactor is
//! free to rename.
//!
//! # The regression this locks in
//!
//! The transcript measure pass used to re-measure the WHOLE transcript every
//! frame, twice (the build pass repeated the work), which is O(total graphemes)
//! with an allocation per row. It is now memoised per run behind
//! `TranscriptMeasureCache`, and the build pass materialises only the viewport.
//!
//! `frame/warm` is the steady state — the cache is hot, so the pass is one
//! content hash per run plus the viewport build. `frame/cold` renders a state
//! whose cache has never been filled, which is the work the old code did on
//! EVERY frame. The ratio between them, at a fixed corpus, IS the win; if a
//! future change reintroduces per-frame full measurement, `warm` converges on
//! `cold` and the regression is visible as a number rather than as a report of
//! sluggish scrolling.
//!
//! Note that `warm` is not free and is not expected to be: the cache-hit path
//! still hashes every run's rows each frame to decide the hit. That cost scales
//! with total transcript content, not with the viewport, so it is the next
//! thing that would bite on a very long session — which is precisely why it is
//! measured at two corpus sizes rather than one.
//!
//! # Determinism
//!
//! The corpus is built in-process from a fixed script of daemon events with
//! fixed identifiers and a fixed timestamp — no clock, no network, no files, no
//! global state. Every bench builds its own `AppState`; nothing is shared.
