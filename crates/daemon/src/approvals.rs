//! Approval broker (STEP 1.6).
//!
//! An approval is a **workflow state**, not a UI modal
//! ([Chapter 04](../../../docs/docs/04-agent-runtime-and-workflows.md)): a run
//! that proposes a side effect requiring human sign-off *parks* in
//! `WaitingForApproval` until an approver resolves it. This module owns the
//! parking mechanism and the durable record; the run-state transition itself is
//! the agent loop's concern (STEP 1.10).
//!
//! ## How a caller awaits a decision
//!
//! [`ApprovalBroker::request`] persists a `pending` row, appends an
//! `ApprovalRequested` event, registers an in-memory waiter, publishes that
//! event to any live subscribers (when the broker is bound to a
//! [`SubscriptionHub`] via [`ApprovalBroker::with_subscriptions`]), and returns
//! the new [`ApprovalId`]. The awaiting run then calls
//! [`ApprovalBroker::await_decision`], which blocks until the waiter is woken by
//! [`ApprovalBroker::resolve`] (a human decision) or
//! [`ApprovalBroker::expire_due`] (a timeout, which behaves as a rejection).
//! Splitting `request` from `await_decision` (rather than returning a
//! `oneshot::Receiver`) lets restart recovery re-register waiters — see
//! [`ApprovalBroker::reload_pending`] — so a resuming run simply calls
//! `await_decision` again; nothing is lost.
//!
//! ## Auto-approval
//!
//! Resolving with [`ApprovalScope::Run`] records the approved row as a *pattern*
//! for its run. [`ApprovalBroker::request`] consults these first: if an identical
//! action (same `run_id` and the same [`action_digest`]) was already approved
//! `Run`-scoped, the new request auto-approves immediately — it still writes an
//! `approved` row and `ApprovalRequested`/`ApprovalResolved` events for
//! auditability — instead of parking. The matching key is `run_id` + the hex
//! SHA-256 of the action's canonical JSON serialization.
//!
//! Waiters live behind a [`std::sync::Mutex`]-guarded map keyed by
//! [`ApprovalId`], each a [`tokio::sync::watch`] channel carrying the eventual
//! [`ApprovalDecision`]. The map is only ever locked for synchronous map
//! operations (never across an `.await`), so a std mutex is the right primitive.
//! `watch` retains the last value, so a decision delivered before the run
//! subscribes is never lost, and multiple observers (a resuming run, an attached
//! client) can subscribe independently. The map is locked through
//! [`lock_recovering`](crate::poison::lock_recovering): a panic elsewhere must
//! not leave every later approval unanswerable, and no partial update of this
//! map can fabricate a decision (see that module's docs).
