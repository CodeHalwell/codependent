//! The automation scheduler and trigger dispatcher — the writer that
//! `migrations/0044_automation.sql` was built for and never had.
//!
//! Before this module `automation_bindings` persisted policy that nothing read:
//! `next_fire_at` was written at create/update time and consulted only by a
//! test, and `automation_receipts`, `automation_attempts` and
//! `automation_leases` had **zero** INSERTs anywhere in the tree — the
//! at-least-once guarantee the schema documents had no implementation.
//!
//! # The three independent double-fire guards
//!
//! SQLite has no `SKIP LOCKED`, so exclusion is built the way
//! [`crate::ledger::append_next_event`] builds it: claim *inside* the write,
//! under `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`, and treat "zero rows" as "another writer won".
//!
//! 1. **The compare-and-swap.** A due binding is advanced with
//!    `UPDATE … WHERE id = ? AND enabled = 1 AND next_fire_at = <the exact value
//!    read>`. A concurrent tick, or a concurrent `update_binding`, changes that
//!    value and the loser's UPDATE affects zero rows. `enabled = 1` is in the
//!    WHERE, never a pre-read, so a binding disabled between the due query and
//!    the claim cannot fire.
//! 2. **The receipt.** `UNIQUE (binding_id, dedup_key)` makes the INSERT itself
//!    the reservation; `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING RETURNING id` returning `None`
//!    means this occurrence (or this delivery) was already reserved.
//! 3. **The workflow store.** `workflow_idempotency_key` is handed verbatim to
//!    `create_run_idempotent_owned`, whose run id is
//!    `deterministic_run_id("owner:{uid}:{key}")` — so even a crash between the
//!    receipt commit and the start resolves to the SAME run on re-drive rather
//!    than a second one.
//!
//! [`automation_leases`] is the coarser outer guard the migration explicitly
//! demands instead of the in-process `DriveLockRegistry`: a row per binding held
//! by a `DaemonInstanceId`, with a monotonic `fence` re-checked inside every
//! claim transaction so a daemon that wakes after its lease expired discovers it
//! was fenced out before it writes.
//!
//! # What an attempt row means
//!
//! An `automation_attempts` row records a **dispatch decision made against a
//! reserved receipt** — which is exactly what its `outcome` vocabulary
//! (`filtered`, `denied`, `skipped_concurrency`, `queued`, `replaced`, `error`,
//! `started`) describes. It is never written speculatively: nothing is inserted
//! for a binding that was not claimed, and `outcome = 'started'` is written ONLY
//! after [`WorkflowStarter::start`] has returned a durable run id.
//!
//! # Fail-closed reads
//!
//! `concurrency`, `missed_run`, `approval_mode` and `source_type` come back out
//! of SQLite as TEXT. Every unrecognized value REFUSES, mirroring the `_ =>`
//! arms in [`crate::automation`]. An unknown `missed_run` must never fall
//! through to `catch_up` and fire an unbounded backlog, and an unknown
//! `approval_mode` must never fall through to `inherit`.
