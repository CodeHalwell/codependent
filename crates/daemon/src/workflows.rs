//! Workflow-start seam (dependency inversion), Phase 5 STEP 5.2.
//!
//! A `StartWorkflow` command creates a durable workflow run that lives in its own
//! store *outside* the session ledger — so, like `MutateDocument`, it is
//! intercepted at the connection level and applied through a seam the daemon
//! declares and the `codypendentd` assembly fills (only the assembly can name
//! `codypendent-workflow` and reach the pool). The default-`None`
//! [`RunExecutor::workflow_starter`](crate::executor::RunExecutor::workflow_starter)
//! leaves it unwired — the lib-only / test server then rejects `StartWorkflow`
//! with `workflow.transport-unavailable`, exactly as an executor-less run stays
//! `Queued`.
