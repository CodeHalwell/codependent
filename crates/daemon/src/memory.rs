//! Memory seam (dependency inversion), outcome 17.
//!
//! `InspectMemory`/`CorrectMemory`/`ForgetMemory`/`ForgetMemoryScope`/
//! `OpenMemoryEvidence` act on the curated-memory store, which lives *outside*
//! the session ledger and inside `codypendent-knowledge` — a crate this one
//! cannot name (the daemon is below knowledge in the graph). So, exactly like
//! [`PromotionGateway`](crate::promotion::PromotionGateway), the daemon
//! declares the seam and the `codypendentd` assembly fills it. The default-`None`
//! [`ServerState::memory`](crate::server::ServerState::memory) leaves it
//! unwired, and the lib-only / test server then rejects every memory command
//! with `memory.transport-unavailable`.
//!
//! # What this seam does NOT decide
//!
//! Scope visibility. The implementation resolves `repository` to a repository
//! identity with the daemon's own single source of truth and asks
//! `codypendentd::memory_ops`, whose whole job is refusing an out-of-scope
//! target **identically** to an absent one. Nothing on the wire lets a caller
//! name a scope key, so the set of scopes a command can reach is derived, never
//! supplied — the same shape as [`ApprovePromotionRequest`'s
//! actor](crate::promotion::ApprovePromotionRequest).
