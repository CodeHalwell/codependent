//! `graph.callers_of` / `graph.blast_radius` / `graph.tests_covering` — the
//! agent's window onto the repository's code graph (outcome 5) — and
//! `graph.assert_edge`, the agent's WRITE onto it.
//!
//! The graph has always been parsed, stored, and queryable; until now the model's
//! only exposure to it was the static `RepositoryMap` text folded once into a
//! run's opening note. It could not ask "who calls this", "what breaks if I
//! change this", or "which tests cover this file" — the three questions the store
//! was built to answer (2026-08-13 review, F3).
//!
//! # The two levers
//!
//! Graph construction has a deterministic lever (tree-sitter: what the parser can
//! see, folded on every scan) and, from here, an **agent** lever: a relation the
//! parser *cannot* see because it does not exist in the syntax — a route table
//! entry to the service it dispatches to, a config key to the code that reads it,
//! a test to the behaviour it covers, a migration to the model it reshapes. The
//! deterministic layer cannot express those; a model reading the code can.
//!
//! The two are kept apart by evidence, not by trust: an assertion is stored as
//! [`EvidenceKind::AgentAsserted`](codypendent_knowledge::EvidenceKind::AgentAsserted)
//! at its own confidence and supersedes only a *strictly less confident* edge, so
//! a model's claim can never displace a compiler- or LSP-resolved fact. The
//! engine enforces that (`codegraph::assert_agent_edges`); this module's job is
//! to make the outcome legible to the model that asked.
//!
//! Like `skills.search` and the MCP bridge, this module holds argument parsing,
//! the seam, and the rendering: the queries, their bounds, and the write engine
//! live in `codypendent_knowledge::codegraph`, and both seams
//! ([`CodeGraphQueries`](codypendent_knowledge::CodeGraphQueries) and
//! [`CodeGraphAssertions`]) are implemented in the daemon assembly, which owns
//! the pool. Without an injected implementation the tools are never offered.
//!
//! Every result is first-party: node names and paths this daemon parsed out of
//! the repository itself. There is no untrusted content to sanitize here, unlike
//! the MCP/web/skill-document arms — a symbol name is bounded by the parser, and
//! `GraphAnswer::render` caps the disclosed rows.
