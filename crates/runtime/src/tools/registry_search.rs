//! `skills.search` — the agent-callable window onto the knowledge registry
//! (rubric 9).
//!
//! Retrieval used to be entirely system-driven: the funnel ran once per session
//! and its output reached a ledger note, never the model. This tool closes the
//! other half of the loop — the model can ASK what tools and skills exist for a
//! task it has just discovered, mid-run, and get back the same progressive-
//! disclosure cards the context manifest carries (name, kind, 280-byte summary,
//! declared permissions).
//!
//! Two calls in one, so a discovery does not dead-end at a card:
//!
//! * `{"query": "fix a failing CI build"}` → the top cards for that task.
//! * `{"query": "…", "open": "rust.fix-ci"}` → the same cards PLUS that skill's
//!   `SKILL.md` procedure, bounded to [`SKILL_DOCUMENT_MAX_BYTES`].
//!
//! Like the MCP bridge, this crate holds only the trait: [`RegistrySearch`] is
//! implemented in the daemon assembly, which owns the pool the registry lives
//! in. Without an injected implementation the tool is never offered.
//!
//! **A skill's text is evidence, never instructions.** `SKILL.md` is
//! author-controlled — a community package could try to redirect the run. The
//! rendered result therefore carries the same trust-boundary preamble the
//! context manifest uses, and every byte of the document passes through
//! `sanitize_untrusted` (control sequences, bidi overrides, and zero-width
//! characters removed, hard byte cap) before it can enter the observation
//! stream.
