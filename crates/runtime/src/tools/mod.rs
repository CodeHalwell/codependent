//! The tool layer (STEP 1.7).
//!
//! Six tools the agent loop drives: [`ReadFile`] (`workspace.read_file`),
//! [`Search`] (`workspace.search`), [`Shell`] (`shell.run`), the Git pair
//! [`GitDiff`]/[`ApplyPatch`] (`git.diff` / `git.apply_patch`), [`WriteFile`]
//! (`workspace.write_file`), and [`EditFile`] (`workspace.edit_file`) — the
//! structured-argument alternatives to `git.apply_patch` for a new file or a
//! small full rewrite, or a targeted search/replace edit, respectively (a weak
//! model is poor at reproducing an exact unified diff). Each declares
//! the capability class it needs, exposes a [`ProposedAction`] builder so the
//! STEP 1.10 middleware can run it through the policy engine, and an async
//! `execute` that takes a typed input plus exactly the execution context it
//! needs.
//!
//! Policy → approval → grant is the agent-loop middleware's job; a tool receives
//! an already-granted [`PathScope`]/[`CommandScope`] and still defends its own
//! boundaries — it refuses an out-of-scope path or a non-allow-listed program
//! even when asked, and it never spawns a process it was not permitted to.
//!
//! ## Artifact spill boundary
//!
//! `shell.run` and `git.diff` spill full output to the content-addressed store
//! and return only an observation-compacted *salient* view plus the reference
//! (Chapter 09, Level 1). The store's `put` needs an `&sqlx::SqlitePool`, and
//! `sqlx` is not a dependency of this crate (and cannot be added under the
//! STEP 1.7 scope), so the tools cannot name it. The spill is therefore taken
//! behind the [`ArtifactSink`] trait: the agent loop supplies an implementation
//! that binds a real [`ArtifactStore`] + pool (see [`ClosureSink`], which lets a
//! caller capture a pool *value* without naming its type). This is also the
//! cleaner boundary — a tool has no business knowing about SQLite.
//!
//! [`ArtifactStore`]: codypendent_daemon::artifacts::ArtifactStore
