//! Durable session events.
//!
//! Events record accepted state changes or observations. They are persisted
//! in the event ledger before any client observes them, and original events
//! are immutable evidence (invariant 5). The Phase 0 seed (session lifecycle)
//! is joined here by the Phase 1 run, model, tool, approval, patch, steering,
//! and budget events. Bulk content is referenced through [`ArtifactRef`]; a
//! bounded human preview may accompany it when clients need an immediately
//! useful timeline card.
