//! `codypendent-codypendentd` — the persistent Codypendent daemon, exposed both
//! as the standalone `codypendentd` binary (`src/main.rs`) and as a library so
//! the single `codypendent` binary can run the SAME daemon in-process via the
//! hidden `codypendent __daemon` subcommand. Installing/updating `codypendent`
//! therefore always updates the daemon — no separate binary on disk to go stale
//! (the client/daemon version-skew bug this crate's library form eliminates).
//!
//! This is the composition root. It depends on BOTH `codypendent-daemon` (the
//! server + persistence) and `codypendent-runtime` (the agent loop) — which the
//! daemon crate itself cannot, because the runtime depends on the daemon (a
//! cycle). [`run_daemon`] performs the daemon startup exactly as the old
//! `main.rs` did (paths already resolved, db, boot, recovery), then constructs a
//! [`RuntimeExecutor`] that drives the runtime agent loop and injects it into
//! the server.

// The agent document channel and the client mutation seam are `pub` so the
// crate's own integration tests can drive the SAME production seams the daemon
// wires (see `tests/docs_agent_it.rs`), rather than re-implementing them.

/// drive the SAME channel the `task.*` tools use, rather than reproducing the
/// board's write rules in test SQL (which would then drift from them).
