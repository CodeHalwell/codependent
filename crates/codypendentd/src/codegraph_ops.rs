//! Daemon-side handlers for `codypendent graph {build,status,show}` — the
//! assembly half of [`codypendent_daemon::codegraph`].
//!
//! # The bug this module closes
//!
//! The code graph was folded only as a side effect of opening a session or
//! starting a run. No command built it, no command described it, and
//! `index rebuild` — whose name reads as "build the index, graph included" —
//! explicitly does not touch it. On a mixed repository the graph came out
//! holding two nodes from one file while thousands of Python and TSX files
//! contributed nothing, and every surface reported that as a plain zero.
//!
//! So the *report* here is the feature, not the fold. [`CodeGraphOps::build`]
//! answers "why is my graph this size?" from two measured sources and no third
//! opinion:
//!
//! * the scan's own [`ScanSummary`] — files seen, files a grammar covered,
//!   files folded, the histogram of extensions no grammar covers, and whether
//!   the file cap truncated the walk. These are the extractor's tallies from
//!   the walk being reported, not a re-derivation of it;
//! * the graph tables themselves, for what the repository now *holds*
//!   (nodes/edges, and the per-language split with edge counts the summary does
//!   not carry).
//!
//! It would have been easy to re-walk the tree here and subtract, or to keep a
//! local list of "extensions we support". Either is a second source of truth for
//! a fact the extractor already owns, and the first time a grammar is added the
//! copy keeps confidently reporting the old languages — a stale claim rendered
//! as a fact, which is the failure mode this command exists to end.
//! [`Language::ALL`] travels on the report for the same reason: the client
//! prints the roster it is told, never one it remembers.
//!
//! # Repository scoping
//!
//! Every request names a filesystem path. [`CodeGraphOps::anchor`] resolves it
//! through the daemon's own [`crate::scan::discover_repository_root`] and hashes
//! the result with [`crate::scan::repository_id_for`] — the same derivation the
//! scan writes under, so a query can never land on an identity nothing was
//! stored beneath (2026-08-13 review, F5). Nothing on the wire lets a client
//! name a repository identity.
//!
//! That scope is applied where the **rows are fetched**, on every path. The
//! by-id read (`graph show --node <id>`) carries `AND repository = ?` in the
//! same statement as the lookup and answers
//! [`node_not_found`](codypendent_daemon::codegraph::node_not_found) for "not
//! yours" and "not there" alike. A gate enforced only where a list is built is
//! not a gate.
