//! Ledger to seed-transcript projection (continuous-session plan, Task 1).
//!
//! [`session_transcript`] is the pure core of a continuation run's seed: it
//! turns a session's persisted [`SessionEvent`]s into the `Vec<TurnItem>` a
//! later task hands the model as a continuation's starting transcript. Pure
//! by construction — events in, `Vec<TurnItem>` out, no pool, no I/O — so it
//! is unit-testable without a database.
//!
//! ## Hybrid: verbatim recent, compacted older
//!
//! Replaying every run's full transcript forever would make each
//! continuation re-pay the entire session's token cost on every follow-up.
//! The last `verbatim_runs` runs (by start order) are reconstructed
//! turn-by-turn; every earlier run collapses into a single compacted
//! [`TurnItem::Assistant`]. Order is preserved throughout: oldest run first,
//! ledger sequence order within a run.
//!
//! ## Why `RunCompleted.chronicle` is never dereferenced
//!
//! `chronicle` is an [`ArtifactRef`] — a pointer into the artifact store, not
//! inline text — so a pure function over `&[SessionEvent]` cannot read it
//! without I/O. `codypendent_knowledge`'s `run_outcome_candidates` (the memory
//! observer) lives with the identical constraint: it cites the chronicle
//! artifact as evidence but never reads its bytes. Compaction here always
//! takes the equivalent fallback: the run's objective, its coalesced
//! assistant reply (concatenated `ModelStreamDelta` text), and — when present
//! — the `RunDisposition`'s own inline summary/reason text. All of it is real
//! ledger text; nothing is fabricated (the T1/T7 cost-honesty ethos extended
//! to transcript content, not just token counts).
//!
//! ## Why a compacted `Steering` turn carries no text
//!
//! Steering text is delivered to a *live* run over an in-process channel
//! (`RunContext::steering`, drained by `drain_steering` in
//! `codypendent_runtime::agent`) and is never written back into the event
//! body: `EventBody::SteeringApplied` carries only the `run_id`. The TUI's own
//! reducer has the identical gap — `TranscriptEntry::Steering { applied }`
//! has no text field either (`crates/tui/src/state.rs`). A replayed
//! `TurnItem::Steering` is therefore an honest empty-string marker — "steering
//! happened here" — never invented wording.
