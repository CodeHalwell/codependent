/**
 * Navigation flow: the sidebar must not present every surface at once, and no

 *
 * The desktop had 22 destinations listed flat and Escape did nothing unless the
 * palette was open, so every secondary view had to be left by aiming at the
 * sidebar again. These tests pin both halves of the fix.
