/**
 * Reasoning is not speech.
 *
 * ACP separates `AgentThoughtChunk` from `AgentMessageChunk`; the daemon merged
 * them until v0.12.2, so a model that deliberates out loud printed its whole
 * deliberation as the reply and buried the answer under it. These tests hold
 * the client end: marked chunks land in their own folded entry, unmarked ones
 * behave exactly as they always did.
