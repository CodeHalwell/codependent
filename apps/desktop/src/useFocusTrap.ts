/**
 * Keyboard focus for a dialog: move it in, keep it in, give it back.
 *
 * Every overlay in the app declared `aria-modal="true"`, which promises a
 * screen reader that focus is confined to the dialog — and none of them
 * confined it. Tab walked straight out of the command palette into the
 * sidebar behind it, and closing any dialog dropped focus on `<body>`, so a
 * keyboard user lost their place every time. The inline confirmations
 * (remove a model, delete a key, consent to a community bridge) never moved
 * focus at all: after clicking Remove the focus stayed on the Remove button,
 * and Enter fired it again.
 *
 * One hook, three duties:
 *
 * 1. On activation, remember what had focus and move focus into the
 *    container — to `initialFocus` when given, else the first focusable
 *    element, else the container itself (which gets `tabIndex=-1` so it can
 *    take focus).
 * 2. While active, wrap Tab and Shift-Tab at the container's edges.
 * 3. On deactivation, restore focus to the remembered element if it is still
 *    in the document.
 *
 * Escape is the caller's business: `onEscape` is invoked with the event and
 * stops propagation, so a dialog's Escape never also reaches the app's
 * "go back" handler — which is how Escape used to dismiss a confirmation AND
 * navigate the view away underneath it.
