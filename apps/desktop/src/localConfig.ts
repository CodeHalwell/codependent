 * - **Councils** live in `<config_dir>/councils.toml` (definitions) and
 *   `<data_dir>/councils/<name>/*.json|.md` (results). There is no `Council`
 *   variant in `CommandBody`; the shell reaches them through the shared
 *   `codypendent-council` crate, exactly as the TUI does. A council *run* does
 *   convene real daemon sessions — one per member plus the chair — but it does
 *   so over its own connections, not this client's transcript.
 * - **The repository** is a local choice that then rides on
 *   `CreateSession`/`AttachSession`/`StartRun` as their `repository` field.
 *
 * Every shape here mirrors a Rust type in `src-tauri/src/council.rs` or
 * `src-tauri/src/repository.rs`, which serialize camelCase.
