/**
 * The desktop client's only route to `codypendentd`.
 *
 * A webview cannot open a Unix domain socket, so the connection lives in the
 * Tauri shell (`src-tauri/src/daemon.rs`) and this module is a thin call
 * surface over it: Tauri commands out, a Tauri channel of daemon frames back.
 * There is no wire codec here — every frame that crosses the boundary was
 * produced by the shared Rust protocol crate (adoption 14 §6, criterion 2).
 *
 * `createTransport()` returns `null` when the app is not running inside the
 * shell (a plain `vite dev` browser tab, or a test). That is deliberate: with
 * no shell there is no transport, and the UI must say so rather than pretend.
