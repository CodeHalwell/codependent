//! The desktop client's connection to `codypendentd`.

//! This is the whole reason the shell has a Rust side (adoption 14 §4.1): a
//! webview cannot open a Unix domain socket, so the connection lives here and
//! the webview only ever sees JSON the shared protocol crate produced. The
//! framing, handshake, and command envelopes are NOT reimplemented — they come
//! from `codypendent_council::connection::Connection`, the same reference
//! client `codypendent run` and the TUI use.
//!
//! Everything in this module is deliberately free of `tauri` types: the sink
//! events are pushed into is a trait, so the transport is exercised in tests
//! against a real Unix socket without a webview (see the tests at the bottom).
