//! Codypendent desktop shell.

//! The Rust side owns the `codypendentd` connection (adoption 14 §4.1); the
//! webview is a projection of daemon state and holds no privileged path of its
//! own. Split in two so the part with logic is testable without a window:
//!
//! - [`daemon`] — the socket connection, built on the shared protocol crate
//!   and the same `Connection` the CLI and TUI use. No `tauri` types.
//! - [`bridge`] — the Tauri commands and event channel that expose it.
//! - [`council`] — councils, which are LOCAL CONFIGURATION (`councils.toml`),
//!   not protocol: the daemon has no council command.
//! - [`repository`] — which checkout the client works in, gated so a folder
//!   that is not a repository (or is `$HOME`) can never reach the indexer.
