//! Which repository the desktop client is working in.
//!
//! The shell had no answer to this before: `daemon_connect` sent
//! `std::env::current_dir()` as the `repository` on every `CreateSession`,
//! `AttachSession` and `StartRun`. For a bundled `.app` that is the launch
//! working directory — `/` under Finder, `$HOME` under a login shell — and the
//! daemon indexes whatever it is handed.
//!
//! # The incident this module exists to prevent
//!
//! A daemon once indexed `$HOME`, reaching a 510,904-node code graph that was
//! 76% IDE cache, with every run spending 30-60s in `Preparing`. The hole was
//! `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`: with `GIT_DIR` inherited from the
//! environment (a git hook, `git rebase -x`, `git bisect run`, an exporting
//! shell) it does not answer "is this a repository" — it answers with the
//! *current directory*, exit 0. `crates/codypendentd/src/scan.rs` fixed that by
//! stripping the repository-location variables from the child environment, and
//! `crates/daemon/src/server.rs::plausible_repository_root` added a second,
//! independent gate that is a pure FILESYSTEM check and never shells out at
//! all.
//!
//! A selection must pass BOTH gates:
//!
//! 1. [`crate::repo_anchor::checkout_root`] — `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`
//!    with those eight variables stripped from the child environment. That call
//!    is NOT repeated here: this crate answers "where does the checkout start"
//!    in exactly one place, so the variable list cannot drift between two
//!    copies and silently re-open the hole it closes. A host with no `git` at
//!    all falls back to [`filesystem_checkout_root`], a pure ancestor walk that
//!    nothing in the environment can redirect.
//! 2. [`plausible_repository_root`] — refuse `$HOME`, refuse a path with fewer
//!    than two named components, and require a `.git` entry at the resolved
//!    root or an ancestor. A FILESYSTEM check with no `git` in it, so a defect
//!    in the question above cannot open the same hole twice.
//!
//! A folder that fails either is REFUSED with the reason. There is no silent
//! fallback to the working directory: that fallback is the defect.
